# Dog-Breed Classifier with PyTorch
*Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree - Udacity Program*

## Project Overview
This project deploys a dog breed classifier that take a user-input image and perform classification based-on pre-trained CNN models (VGG-16, Inception-v3, Resnet-50) provided by Pytorch.
